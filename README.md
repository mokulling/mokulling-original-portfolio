README files contain the following items: description of application, screenshot, and link to the deployed application. This will be required on all of your projects throughout the bootcamp, so it is a good checklist when creating your READMEs. Think of these READMEs as a quick brochure that you hand out to the users of your application. Well-developed READMEs look very impressive to employers that will be reviewing your GitHub repos!
